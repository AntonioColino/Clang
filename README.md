# Clang
Clang compiler build scripts for visual studio that support Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android.
Adds support in visual studio for IntelliSense in visual studio for different platform's. 
Planning to get as many underlying fundemental compiler toolchains, platform abi's from os vendors 
and gpu makers as possible in one standing environment. Inital does GCC,MSVC,WIN,MAC,LINUX,CLANG. 
I plan to go through these one at a time adding the appropriate lib sources rewritten to work in natively in each 
enviornment and each others, for a single standing toolchain as part of a larger project.
